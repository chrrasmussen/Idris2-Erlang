Structure of this test
----------------------

This test case is a bit special because of the big output generated by the
various test cases. Instead of having a single pair of `expected` and `output`
files, we use one pair per test file.

The diffs for each pair is then appended to the main `output` file. So the
`expected` file is empty and should stay empty.

How to fix this test?
---------------------

Run `./regenerate PATH/TO/IDRIS2`
