-- FOLDABLE, TRAVERSABLE --
---------------------------

||| The `Foldable` interface describes how you can iterate over the elements in
||| a parameterised type and combine the elements together, using a provided
||| function, into a single result.
||| @ t The type of the 'Foldable' parameterised type.
public export
interface Foldable t where
  ||| Successively combine the elements in a parameterised type using the
  ||| provided function, starting with the element that is in the final position
  ||| i.e. the right-most position.
  ||| @ func  The function used to 'fold' an element into the accumulated result
  ||| @ init  The starting value the results are being combined into
  ||| @ input The parameterised type
  foldr : (func : elem -> acc -> acc) -> (init : acc) -> (input : t elem) -> acc

  ||| The same as `foldr` but begins the folding from the element at the initial
  ||| position in the data structure i.e. the left-most position.
  ||| @ func  The function used to 'fold' an element into the accumulated result
  ||| @ init  The starting value the results are being combined into
  ||| @ input The parameterised type
  foldl : (func : acc -> elem -> acc) -> (init : acc) -> (input : t elem) -> acc
  foldl f z t = foldr (flip (.) . flip f) id t z

  ||| Test whether the structure is empty.
  ||| @ acc The accumulator value which is specified to be lazy
  null : t elem -> Lazy Bool
  null = foldr {acc = Lazy Bool} (\ _,_ => False) True

||| Similar to `foldl`, but uses a function wrapping its result in a `Monad`.
||| Consequently, the final value is wrapped in the same `Monad`.
public export
foldlM : (Foldable t, Monad m) => (funcM: a -> b -> m a) -> (init: a) -> (input: t b) -> m a
foldlM fm a0 = foldl (\ma,b => ma >>= flip fm b) (pure a0)

||| Maps each element to a value and combine them
public export
foldMap : (Foldable t, Monoid m) => (a -> m) -> t a -> m
foldMap f = foldr ((<+>) . f) neutral

||| Combine each element of a structure into a monoid.
public export
concat : (Foldable t, Monoid a) => t a -> a
concat = foldr (<+>) neutral

||| Combine into a monoid the collective results of applying a function to each
||| element of a structure.
public export
concatMap : (Foldable t, Monoid m) => (a -> m) -> t a -> m
concatMap f = foldr ((<+>) . f) neutral

||| The conjunction of all elements of a structure containing lazy boolean
||| values.  `and` short-circuits from left to right, evaluating until either an
||| element is `False` or no elements remain.
public export
and : Foldable t => t (Lazy Bool) -> Bool
and = foldl (&&) True

||| The disjunction of all elements of a structure containing lazy boolean
||| values.  `or` short-circuits from left to right, evaluating either until an
||| element is `True` or no elements remain.
public export
or : Foldable t => t (Lazy Bool) -> Bool
or = foldl (||) False

||| The disjunction of the collective results of applying a predicate to all
||| elements of a structure.  `any` short-circuits from left to right.
public export
any : Foldable t => (a -> Bool) -> t a -> Bool
any p = foldl (\x,y => x || p y) False

||| The disjunction of the collective results of applying a predicate to all
||| elements of a structure.  `all` short-circuits from left to right.
public export
all : Foldable t => (a -> Bool) -> t a -> Bool
all p = foldl (\x,y => x && p y)  True

||| Add together all the elements of a structure.
public export
sum : (Foldable t, Num a) => t a -> a
sum = foldr (+) 0

||| Add together all the elements of a structure.
||| Same as `sum` but tail recursive.
export
sum' : (Foldable t, Num a) => t a -> a
sum' = foldl (+) 0

||| Multiply together all elements of a structure.
public export
product : (Foldable t, Num a) => t a -> a
product = foldr (*) 1

||| Multiply together all elements of a structure.
||| Same as `product` but tail recursive.
export
product' : (Foldable t, Num a) => t a -> a
product' = foldl (*) 1

||| Map each element of a structure to a computation, evaluate those
||| computations and discard the results.
public export
traverse_ : (Foldable t, Applicative f) => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f ()
traverse_ f = foldr ((*>) . f) (pure ())

||| Evaluate each computation in a structure and discard the results.
public export
sequence_ : (Foldable t, Applicative f) => t (f a) -> f ()
sequence_ = foldr (*>) (pure ())

||| Like `traverse_` but with the arguments flipped.
public export
for_ : (Foldable t, Applicative f) => t a -> (a -> f b) -> f ()
for_ = flip traverse_

||| Fold using Alternative.
|||
||| If you have a left-biased alternative operator `<|>`, then `choice` performs
||| left-biased choice from a list of alternatives, which means that it
||| evaluates to the left-most non-`empty` alternative.
|||
||| If the list is empty, or all values in it are `empty`, then it evaluates to
||| `empty`.
|||
||| Example:
|||
||| ```
||| -- given a parser expression like:
||| expr = literal <|> keyword <|> funcall
|||
||| -- choice lets you write this as:
||| expr = choice [literal, keyword, funcall]
||| ```
|||
||| Note: In Haskell, `choice` is called `asum`.
public export
choice : (Foldable t, Alternative f) => t (f a) -> f a
choice = foldr (<|>) empty

||| A fused version of `choice` and `map`.
public export
choiceMap : (Foldable t, Alternative f) => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f b
choiceMap f = foldr (\e, a => f e <|> a) empty

public export
interface (Functor t, Foldable t) => Traversable t where
  ||| Map each element of a structure to a computation, evaluate those
  ||| computations and combine the results.
  traverse : Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)

||| Evaluate each computation in a structure and collect the results.
public export
sequence : (Traversable t, Applicative f) => t (f a) -> f (t a)
sequence = traverse id

||| Like `traverse` but with the arguments flipped.
public export
for : (Traversable t, Applicative f) => t a -> (a -> f b) -> f (t b)
for = flip traverse
